'''
Ingests the `recordings` table and groups recordings by location into 1Ã—1
degree "squares" of latitude and longitude, writing the output to the
`regions` table.

Of course, the farther you go from the equator, the more narrow and pointy
these become, but this is not really a problem for our purposes because most
birds don't live on the poles anyway.

For each square, it creates a ranking of which species were recorded, from most
to least. Basing this on the number of _recordings_, rather than some other
source like the number of _occurrences_ or _sightings_ of a species, makes
sense for this app; after all, what we most care about is which birds you're
likely to hear most.
