'''
Loads species observations from `ebd_regions.csv` which was produces by
the `ebd_aggregator` program. These are regions of 1Ã—1 degree latitude and
longitude, and for each region we have a count of how often the species was
observed there.

Of course, the farther you go from the equator, the more narrow and pointy
these become, but this is not really a problem for our purposes because most
birds don't live on the poles anyway.

A complication is that eBird uses the Clemens taxonomy, whereas xeno-canto uses
IOC. Fortunately IOC publishes a mapping between the two, which is applied
here.
